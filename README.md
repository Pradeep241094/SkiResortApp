# This app was created using Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

Also, I have deployed the application using AWS AMPLIFY service through a git CD Pipeline to take the latest build as soon as the code is committed to the main branch.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### npm install

This installs all the dependencies in the Project (Make sure you have all the dependencies installled)

### `npm run start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

to start the json db server, on your local terminal, Run it in another tab:

### `npm run api`

Open [http://localhost:8080/skiresorts](http://localhost:8080/skiresorts) to view the records from the endpoint in your browser.

this starts the json db server with a delay of 1500ms
